-1,"I got 'new' tires from them and within two weeks got a flat. I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \nI took the tire over to Flynn's and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he'd give me a new tire \""this time\"". \nI will never go back to Flynn's b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!"
-1,"Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing."
-1,"All I can say is the worst! We were the only 2 people in the place for lunch, the place was freezing and loaded with kids toys! 2 bicycles, a scooter, and an electronic keyboard graced the dining room. A fish tank with filthy, slimy fingerprints smeared all over it is there for your enjoyment.\n\nOur food came... no water to drink, no tea, medium temperature food. Of course its cold, just like the room, I never took my jacket off! The plates are too small, you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. The fried noodles were out of a box and nasty, the shrimp was mushy, the fried rice was bright yellow.\n\nWe asked for water, they brought us 1 in a SOLO cup for 2 people. I asked for hot tea, they said 10 minutes. What Chinese restaurant does not have hot tea available upon request?\n\nOver all.... my first and last visit to this place. The only good point was that it was cheap, and deservingly so."
-1,"I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around."
-1,Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.
0,"This is a tiny Starbucks and it locations like this (although cute) makes you wonder if your really meant to hang out or just grab your coffee and leave. Leaving is always a good idea at this location anyway since you have a nice fountain in the back with benches and it is a central part of the Waterfront Shopping. \n\nStarbuck isn't my favorite coffee chain by any means. Is it just me or do all Starbuck coffees taste a little burnt and bitter? No matter how trendy, cool and upscale their establishments are I can't get around the yicky tasting bitterness of Staryucks regular coffees. Talk about over roasting a bean...Maybe something has changed with their regular coffee but I have not drank it in about a year. I am not one for soy caramel latte foofy stuff. Still I'll give the establishment tres estrellas for the fact that their espresso is acceptable and doesn't taste half as bad as the regular coffee bean."
-1,"Typical Starbucks coffee chain. 2 things I dont like about this Starbucks: \n\n1. Ive been there twice and both times the place has been dirty, compared to the other Starbucks I have been in.\n\n2. If you have to use the bathroom, they give you a key thats attached to this nasty bottle. Im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightly.\n\nAside from that, good coffee and fast/friendly service."
1,"So.Much.Fun! \n\nI WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat. Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop. \n\nThis is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night. \n\nKeep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! \n\nThe guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. \n\nMy favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!). \n\nThe birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. But in a totally nice way of course. You just have to go!"
1,"My friend is a piano teacher, so I took it as a good sign that Sing Sing would be quality stuff. It was her birthday, and I didn't really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong. \n\nIt was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they're covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It's obvious they've been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it's rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, \""Rubber Ducky\"" and \""Gangsta's Paradise\"" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for \""anything else,\"" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like \""yinz\"" instead of \""you.\""\n\nI saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there's not even an intermission. I've read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend's birthday. \""I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,\"" he said when she requested him.\n\nThere were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can't laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.\n\nLuckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.\n\nSing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbr\u00e4uhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. Definitely belongs on every required Pittsburgh experiences list."
0,Stopped by on a Mon evening after trying to dine at Smoke Taqueria which is closed Mondays. Parking on street in front or behind off Hay St. Super friendly bartender. In warmer months they have huge outdoor area & big screen & upstairs cornhole game area. Okay draft beer selection and big bottle selection. Tried the italian club which was really good - two of us split one. Also tried sweet potato fries - amazingly good! Home made chips w bleu were overpowered by sauce. Bathroom was in need of plaster and wall repairs & was grossed out by toilet brush/holder on a shelf near toilet at eye level. Bet it's a fun place in warmer months.
-1,"Think Chuck E. Cheese for adults.  Skee Ball, video games pool tables.  Clean environment.  Good fun.\n\nUnfortunately, I went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu.  I ended up settling for spinach dip.  Sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  Blahhhh.  Trying to get something healthy, I ordered the apple pecan salad.  I swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  I could barely eat the salad.  Too sweet.\n\nMy mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  The steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried AGAIN!  Yowzer!  Artery clogger for sure.  \n\nI like the atmosphere.  I like the bar area.  Perhaps next time we'll just stop by for drinks instead."
1,"We came here on a Saturday night and luckily it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. I love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) We only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. I love their new Wheel of Fortune game! On our first play, we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun. Too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would come back. Hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion."
-1,"To keep it short and sweet: Save yourself $100. Buy a good board game, your alcohol of choice, order a pizza, and invite your friends over. \n\nWhat an incredible disappointment. After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \n\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead."
-1,"Microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when they're better than the beer I would have drank otherwise.  One waitress I had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as \""kind of like Coors Light\"".  If I wanted Coors, I'll pay half as much and have one.  \n\nThe food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  Head next door to Sing Sing for drinks, though."
1,"This is literally the first place I went when I first came to Pittsburgh - and I loved it. Hearty, full-sized meals, lots to choose from, and not too crowded or noisy. Although, for the sake of full disclosure, I didn't sit at the bar and I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment on that. I go back to Pittsburgh often and Rock Bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night. Really, I have no complaints about this place so I'm surprised by the few low ratings here."
1,"Wast there last Friday. Seats right in front if the stage. The show was good. The headliner, while a bit long, was good. Fantastic service from our waitresses. Will definitely go back."
0,"Great Barnes and Noble location, and they have plenty of books that'll help you pass the time."
-1,"The words \""epic fail\"" get thrown around a lot these days....but I really feel like they apply in this situation.\n\nWe went on Friday, April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  It was busy, but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  Half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.\n\nThe food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  Drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  We placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*\n\nBy 7:00, we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  We just wanted to leave.\n\nInstead of comping anything, they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  Uhhhh yeah.  Thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   We finally were able to leave around 7:30.\n\nBar Louie:  You are dead to me."
-1,"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.\n\nI am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThis is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. \n\nAs I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service."
0,"This place was pretty good food, but the service however was just horrible. As a friend said they hire for looks, not work ethic. Plus the fact that it took forty minutes just to get a couple appetizers was ridiculous. Our server seemed more interested in the table full of girls than actually waiting on us. The couple behind us came in the same time and wasn't even attended too until after OUR appetizers were being cleared off. \n\nThe food was pretty good, but because of the service I won't be returning."
-1,"The evites are in the mail for the 2 for $99 special! You will have to spend $24 on a parking pass. I signed up last year for this promotion and don't think I got the passes worth. \n\nThe waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for a hot summer day. There are just too many misses in my book though.\n\n1st off all Traffic is a biatch! Be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. \n\nNext remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place. (I'm not a mean kid hater) my experiences have been bad at the Sandbar pool. \n\nIf you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that WILL push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they won't use them because they run around the park all day. I actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid. I was like \""I'm an adult and you need to have some respect.\"" He pushed me and took all the chairs. I only needed one and his mother did not correct him. I was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because I moved the chairs over...THAT NO ONE was even there to sit in at the time. Damn! FOR REAL!\n\nSandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak. Plus they are so sugary. If you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minutes. An Adult area would change all this. I don't even care that I'm getting splashed all the time I do realize that I'm at a pool but it's hard to relax.\n\nIf you do get a pass have a friend who can get there the same days you can go. If you're trying to go on the weekend forget it! The weekdays are bad enough. I'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer."
0,"This place is kind of a hybrid of Applebee's and CPK, which isn't to say it's bad, but nothing to rave about either. I got their slider meal, which was tiny (for me) and my friend got their steak (which was way tiny). The food was fine and the service was okay, but really felt like an Applebee's knockoff (and Applebee's isn't even worth knocking-offing anyway). \n\n3 stars"
-1,"I really don't know why I bother with chain restaurants anymore.  Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.  \n\nMy husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.  \n\nWhen the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: \""chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.\""  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate \""drizzling\"" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.\n\nWhat we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  \n\nThe \""numero uno\"" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.  \n\nThe ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  \n\nAnd lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?  It's baffling."
0,"I think the location in homestead has ruined this place. Dirty dirty dirty.\n\nBathrooms unkept, entry door handle and windows filthy\n\nPizza had too much sauce on it and was drenched. Server was coarse, not refined\n\nServing items were old and rusty. Temperature of food was not hot\n\nLow quality, but probably ok with pittsburgher s"
0,"Last week was my first visit to this place. The raspberry tea was amazing. We got the app sampler,  it was very good except for the homemade guacamole. I ordered a side salad, hardly any dressing on it, and not very fresh. I ordered the stuffed chicken with broccoli & grilled vegetables.  Waited along time for the entr\u00e9e.  The chicken was good but a small portion.  The broccoli & veggies were water logged. Lots of water on the plate. Tried my friends fried shrimp, it was good with good flavor. Might have just been who was in the kitchen that night so I would give it another shot."
-1,"I hate this place.\nIt's very loud, the service is very poor, and the food is so-so.\nIf you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh, try China Palace (Shadyside) or Sesame Inn (Station Square or North Hills).  They're quieter, with very good food & service."
-1,"REDO!\n\nI went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  \n\nMy issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  \n\nMy resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.\n\nSo we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:\n\nCoca Cola\nIced Tea\nPan fried pork dumplings\nSesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup\nChangs chicken with white rice\n\nOur drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.\n\nMy egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.\n\nOur lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  \n\nI just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better."
1,"First, this is a big chain - not my favorite type of eatery.  For me, four stars is max for this type of establishment for the simple reason that no one has license to create anything truly unique...\n\nHowever!  The Chilean Sea Bass Marinated in Oolong Tea is freakin' fantastic!  10+\n\nNow - everyone was happy with their meals and let me tell you it was a ridiculously busy night, servers were threading their way through patrons waiting to be seated and our service was very good.\n\nI've been to PFC Vegas and PFC NYC - our Homestead PFC definitely beats them both.  So many great little places to try in the 'Burgh, but I wouldn't resist going back to this particular PFC."
1,"This is by far my favorite Panera location in the Pittsburgh area. Friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good quality food & coffee. Panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free WiFi! Try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon."
-1,"I went here on a recent business trip, and there aren't many decent options in West Homestead, so I decided to splurge on the company's dollar and  ordered take-out.   \n\nI was highly disappointed in the service, and I only ordered take out.    Upon going to the bar to announce that I was there for take out, there were 3 other people at the bar.   The bartender had her back to me and it wasn't until a few minutes had passed that another guest told her that she should wait on me.    \n\nAfter announcing the reason for my visit, she checks on my order (not ready yet) and helps other tables.  No offer of water, or a drink.  Another gentleman working the bar asked the bartender if she had offered me a drink, she stated to him my order would be right up.   He then asked if she offered me a water, to which she replied, her order is going to be right up.    He placed a glass of water in front of me.\n\nThen I hear my name and order announced by the kitchen staff.   3 staff members yelled. .  .\""it's TAKEOUT\""  so back it went into the kitchen to be packed up.\n\nGentelman bartender asks female bartender if she has rung me up yet (she had not)\n\nAfter more time had passed (how long does it take to put food into a takeout container?)   it finally is put down in front of me.  She then rings me up.   I don't expect take out to be piping hot, but at this point i wondered if it was even going to be room.\n\nWhen i go to eat my meal, utensils were not included.  I now had to go find something to eat my lukewarm food with. \n\nVERY DISAPPOINTING experience.   Will not be returning."
1,Very very good chain family restaurant. I had their yellowfin tuna steak shanghai style and it was great. Service was excellent and the party of 5 I was with swore they could eat there every week as the menu was extremely diverse. It's hard for me to give a chain 5/5 but this is pretty close.
1,Good. One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Went yesterday with family and enjoyed oysters(very fresh). I always like appetizers more than their entrees
-1,"You know it's bad when a McDonald's gets a 1 star review...I mean, seriously: none of us expect anything fancy when we go to a McDonald's. The whole point of going to McDonald's is indulging in some not-good-for-you food on the go in your busy life. In my case, I just wanted a small meal/snack that wouldn't cost me as much as the stuff in Kennywood would. I hadn't even eaten at a McDonald's in about eight years or so. And I quickly remembered why!\n\nForget the fact that McDonald's food isn't great. We all know it's not great. The problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food. For starters, I quickly discovered that the drive-thru here is the ABSOLUTE slowest line on planet Earth. You certainly won't be getting any fast food here! Then, once I FINALLY placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.\n\nI concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely. Just keep driving. Anywhere else is better and less of a waste of your time and money, and the people here are so slow that you'll spend more time waiting for your food then you will eating it."
1,This place is amazing!!! Jim is a great artist!!! Traveled all the way from Tampa just to get my tattoo!!! I would recommend this place to everyone!!!
-1,"BEFORE Pino's was renovated, it was a tiny, unpretentious, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a friendly atmosphere, and amazing Italian food. It was also a BYOB, which I love. This was our \""go-to\"" restaurant.\n\nAFTER Pino's was renovated, there was a complete transformation. While the interior is now very nice, It's no longer a BYOB, and the staff is full of attitude, which seems to stem from the total arrogance of Pino himself.\n\nOn our most recent visit, we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 PM. We arrived at 7:25, and weren't even acknowledged until 7:40 PM. Pino was playing maitre d', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly UN-apologetic. There were no open tables, despite having reservations. When 8:00 PM rolled around, I was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. Pino then literally threw our menu's at us, and walked away. Not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience.\n\nThe food is still good here, but I refuse to give my money to someone who CLEARLY does not appreciate your business. There are SO many good restaurants in the area, with owners/chefs who are happy to have you. Next time you think about going here, walk an extra block to the Point Brugge Cafe."
-1,"Terrible! I got a haircut here once and hated it, but kept waiting for it to settle in after a few washes. It never did look right, so I just fixed it at home rather than going back to these incompetent people. I didn't even feel like the hassle of complaining was worth it, as I highly doubted that I'd get any money refunded and I certainly didn't want them to touch my hair again to try to fix it. \n\nI then figured, hey, this place sucks for haircuts but they can't mess up eyebrow waxing, right? Right! But their service is so bad that I gave up on that too -- I got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble, but the last time I went in, I had called ahead to put my name in and was told that I would be next on the list, and to show up in about 20 min. My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead. There was one man sitting there waiting, who I had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me. \n\nThe \""stylist\"" was just finishing up a haircut, so I should have been next, right, since I had put my name in before the guy who walked in? Nope! She called him over and I said \""sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line\"" and the lady said \""oh we don't do that.\"" WTF?? You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this? So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. \n\nAnd waited, and waited, while one \""stylist\"" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been \""on break,\"" or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said \""after I'm done here,\"" and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving. Will never go back."
1,This cafe's espresso drinks are on par with the best artisinal coffee houses anywhere.  I always go out of my way to get coffee from here when I'm in Pittsburgh.
1,"I love Tazza D'oro! It is in such a great little area and is a nice place to spend some time with a delicious cup of coffee.\n\nIt it sometimes busy and hard to find a table (which is not surprising since it's a great spot), but I like the neighborhood feel and the staff has always been very friendly.\n\nI usually get iced Americanos in the summer and regular coffee or lattes in the cooler weather. All of the drinks I have ever had here have been tasty. I have also had some of the pastries (and maybe a bagel at some point?) and everything has been fresh.\n\nI'm a big lover of coffee shops and this place fits all of my requirements. While I don't live in Highland Park, it's definitely worth an occasional trip."
-1,"The coffee isn't good and they don't seem to care. If you're a local, I get that it's the only game in town but this place isn't worth traveling for. \n\nI really wanted to like tazza d'oro. I've been several times, hoping that my bad experiences were isolated incidences. I drink espresso. I know what it should taste like and what it looks like when the person making it gives a damn. I have no complaints about paying $3.00 for an espresso but if it isn't right and I let you know you should probably try again. \n\nThe last time I went in, both baristas admitted they hadn't tried/pulled the espresso I ordered. The gentlemen working there, who was very nice, pulled my shot. I tried it and it was very sour. I let the girl standing directly in front of me know that I didn't think it was pulling correctly and her response was an unenthused look and the comment \""ya well we just got it\"". Silly me to have expected that you also want the espresso you \""just got\"" to taste good...\n\nThis place clearly isn't going anywhere in the near future. It's a favorite with locals who like to hangout there. It's just a shame that they seem to have all of the equipment and even the beans to make at least a decent shot and they don't seem to care about actually pulling it off."
-1,"Superbowl Sunday at the Blues. i came to meet a group of friends to watch the \"" who really cares about this game\""  show. I was mainly interested in seeing Madonna. I do have to say that we had a server who gave us the utmost attention. We had been seated at some tables near the bar mid restaurant that were wobbling and driving me crazy. At the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat. Much better view to see the Material girl! So our server gets 5 STARS! Not only for that reason, she kept the glasses full and kept checking in with us, and took it all in stride as we ordered at different times and all had separate checks. Very classy, wish I could remember her name. Young girl with dirty blond hair. \n\nThe food was pretty blah in my opinion. Bar food none too exceptional. We had nachos that were on slightly stale chips. Good size. Everyone had a burger or sandwich. As I glanced over to my friends Pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate. She said it was \""EH\"". I ordered a Gobbler Club sandwich. It was humongous but not that tasty, pretty dry. How can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and I didn't like it at all. Bad texture. The commercials and time with fun friends saved the experience but I wouldn't go back to eat. Just drinks and sports. I like the location. Easy to park. Close to shadyside. Madonna really was the show stopper this night and unless she performs here I most likely won't be back."
-1,"Pass on this place, there are better restaurants mere feet away.\n\nThe menu here is too large, which is a sure sign none of the food is going to be good.  And, its not good.  Some of the salads are alright, but its just not good food.\n\nThe service is friendly and prompt, but the beer is over priced.  They do have a good selection though.\n\nThis place is open late if you need a bite to eat, but there are so much better options out there."
-1,Wings are overpriced. And the quality of them are bad. They were tough and greasy. The staff are pleasant but then over all experience was too expensive for a sports bar.
1,The decor is nothing fancy but the food is surprisingly good (and fresh). I've gotten takeout and eaten at the buffet. Both good for the price - it's inexpensive.
-1,"The hot and sour soup was ok. Everything else was basically inedible. Water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. More than 1/4 of the buffet was american food, and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be \""krab\"", considering the price of the buffet. No pot-stickers, no pork egg rolls, no spareribs, no won-ton soup."
1,"The first time I came here, I waited in line for 20 minutes.  When it was my turn, I realized I left my wallet in the car.  It hurt so bad, I didn't come back for a year.\n\nI can walk to this place from my house- which is dangerous because those biscuits are just OH SO DREAMY.  I can't describe them.  Just get some.\n\nDo I feel guilty about noshing on fabulous Strawberry Napoleons and Jewish Pizza (kind of like a modified, yet TOTALLY delicious fruitcake bar) at 10:15am?  Hecks, naw... But they do have quiche and some other breakfast-y items for those who prefer a more traditional approach to your stomach's opening ceremony.\n\nJust go early :)  They open at 10 on Saturdays.  And bring cash...it's easier that way."
-1,"I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.\n\nBut their pizza was remarkably terrible.\n\nWent there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a \""personal\"" pie, costs $7 and is 7\"" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a \""small,\"" which is 10\"". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.\n\nThere are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.\n\nThe friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, \""I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good.\"" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10\"" pizza is, and started eating.\n\nLet me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, \""well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine.\"" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, \""it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.\""\n\nI ate three out of the six \""slices.\"" (One sixth of a 10\"" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.\n\nAshamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.\n\nWent home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up.\n\nI know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh."
0,"So I went back to Casbah for dinner and was totally underwhelmed. The granola I had for brunch (in my previous review) was better than my entire dinner put together. The service was better at dinner then at brunch, but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. Definitely go for brunch! But it's not worth the money for dinner. Mediocre food in a nice atmosphere with good service is still mediocre food..."
-1,"Had a very lack-luster Mother's Day brunch at Casbah yesterday. Despite having a very late reservation time of 2:30 p.m., we were seated in the dungeon-like basement dining room. I asked for tables upstairs in the daylight but there was allegedly no way to accommodate my request. Worst part about the basement is the thumping from the sub-woofer located above -- really ridiculous. Service was fine. Timing of drinks and first brunch course were acceptable given it was a busy day, but then gap of 35+ minutes for entrees left us all sitting there, not enjoying the dark of the basement nore the perpetually thumping base. An utterly forgettable mother's day brunch (luckily she took it in stride) but I think Casbah will not be at the top of the list in my book for quite awhile."
1,"So I hated this Soba place owned by the same people, and I happen to stumble into this joint for lunch. It had a great sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). Not sure how they are owned by the same people as Soba (I mean, obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price, no?  Maybe the dishes are just hit and miss, and I got a hit here, whereas I had a serious miss over at Soba.  In any case, the crab sandwich was good-- nice, large chunks of crab.  No overkill on the sauce.  The soup was likewise good.  I don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience!  The wine, however, was overpriced for the quality.  I guess people aren't from SF and expect good wines for the same price!  Save your money, buy a nice $40-60 bottle at home and have a much better vino experience but pay less (or the same!)."
-1,"For the record, I have returned a few times and still entirely stand by my original review from nearly 3 years ago. I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a \""yes, it's got lemon in it.\"" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, \""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink.\"" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. \n\nAlso, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there."
1,"This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah."
0,"To be honest, I feel that this is one of the most overpriced restaurants in the entire city. The food is average to good, the place is beautiful with outdoor seating, but in my opinion the price is just not worth it. They have a really good happy hour, so I would definitely recommend going to that and maybe trying an appetizer or two."
0,"Stopped here for drinks before we went on to dinner elsewhere. In hindsight, we wish we had stayed here. :-)\n\nWe had a couple of great beers and just enjoyed the excellent music soundtrack before we moved on to our next designation. I hope to come back here sometime in the future and actually have...a meal. I like this funkier part of town."
-1,"Maybe I am just the most jaded vegan in town; Quiet Storm's food menu bores me to tears, that which I will use to salt my own mediocre cooking at home! Their coffee isn't all that great either, as given the choice, local La Prima is in my favor. Tears. This is the only vegetarian restaurant on the East side of town, and oh so close to me, but I cannot stand to go there. Desperate times now call for toast and tea served by the sad server that resides within my depressed little dining room."
1,"I've only been here for Sunday brunch, but I look forward to dining here again in the hopefully near future.  The frittata was thicker than any I've seen elsewhere (it looked like a square of lasagna) but very tasty.  I liked the inclusion of sliced potatoes.\n\nThe Low Country grits were creamy and also enjoyable, but not too flavorful.  I didn't really taste the fakin' bacon or the garlic supposedly in the dish.  I'm not surprised though,  since a lot of vegetarian places seem to go light on the seasoning.  Definitely ask for cheddar with your grits if you eat dairy.  The three kinds of hot sauce on the table also help perk things up.\n\nNo complaints about the service, but they use some sort of chemical cleaner (for the floors or to wipe down the tables, maybe?) that's unpleasant-smelling.  I noticed it less the longer we stayed, maybe because I got food in front of me, but one would hope that a vegetarian establishment might opt for more environmentally friendly and less noxious cleaners.  Other diners were also commenting on the smell when we were there.  I'm guessing this isn't a regular smell to the place, though, since no other reviewers have commented on it.  \n\nThe cash-only policy is also a bit of a nuisance, since I'd consider the prices ($11 for brunch entrees) here to be mid-range and not ultra-cheap.  Still, I will come again with my greenbacks."
1,"right by my house, spicy peanut and cheesy snake are amazing."
-1,"I'm going to revise my review of Quiet Storm.\n\nYou may get lucky and find yourself faced with an awesome rendering of a fabulously-designed vegetarian sandwich. In my experience, however (considering the 30+ Cubanos I've eaten there), you're more likely to get a sad, mediocre rendition.\n\nConsistency is not their strong point.\n\nAdd to that the likelihood that you may be dosed with some surly owner attitude, and I've decided to steer clear.\n\nIt's a shame that I no longer feel it's worth it to chase the beautiful dream of my first meals at Quiet Storm. It's also a shame that many of their staff are wonderful, friendly, and helpful, and yet their efforts are overshadowed.\n\nSorry, Quiet Storm. As a Pittsburgh vegetarian, I want to love you. But you broke my heart."
-1,"I really, really wanted to like this restaurant. Hip, quirky, vegetarian/vegan. Lots of owls and kitschy deco. I eat meat occasionally, but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit, and thought this would be a great choice. What's not to love, right? \n\nWell, for starters, the service. Our server was really nice, and had lots of reviews, suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly, ridiculously slow-- and the place was half empty. Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I'm not really a messy eater, but come on!\n\nMaybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the \""firesticks\"" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake.\n\nWe had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake, we decided to hit The Milkshake Factory on East Carson instead."
1,Love this place! The decor inside is really cool.\n\nI'm not from the area but I try to stop in every time I'm traveling through. So many great veg options and great drinks.
-1,"It's cheap, I'll say that, but otherwise it's bland food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working, and when they do, only respond snarkily. There are many better vegetarian and vegan options to choose from."
1,"Our favorite place to go for chocolate peanut butter soy milkshakes. We've been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and everything we've gotten has been incredibly delicious. Love this place!"
-1,"Ew. Okay, not the worst pizza ever, but it's pretty far down my list of pizzerias...and that's sad, considering I quite literally live across the street from it. This should be my go-to pizza destination but I'd rather pay a delivery charge than eat their pizza. The sauce is way too sweet (like, Papa Johns sweet) and there isn't enough cheese. There are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this. The only thing I enjoy about Pizza Perfectta is that their sign hilariously claims, \""Excitingly flavored!\"" Personally, I wasn't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza. Maybe if they wouldn't have tempted me with such language I would be less pissed off at them. Two stars only because they let me borrow some paper cups when I moved into my apartment and hadn't unpacked my kitchen stuff yet. Without them I may have had to travel half a block north and grab some from a different restaurant. Thanks, Pizza Perfectta.\n\nOh, and here's a little Italian lesson for you: it's \""perfetta,\"" not \""perfectta.\"""
-1,"Refused to take my cat, which had passed away, for cremation cause I had not been to the clinic previously. IMHO that's ridiculous. I will not recommended anyone to ever come here."
1,"I'm definitely a fan of East End Food Co-op.  Their produce is always very fresh and of really high quality-it keeps really well once you get it home too, and while prices are slightly higher than an average grocery store, it's definitely worth it.  My favorite part of the Co-op is the bulk section-- it's a great way to buy items in the exact quanities you need rather than ending up with way more than you want!  The same goes for the spices--such a bargain!  The Juice bar has great smoothies and juices--they're a little pricier than I'm used to, but great for a bit of a splurge!"
0,"The products and service are great, but the prices are outrageous!\n\nI am on a vegan diet and have found this co-op really helpful. If you can get past the prices, the selection is great!"
1,"East End Food Co-op is awesome!\n\nIf I had to choose between the Co-op and WF, the Co-op is where it's at.\n\nThere is a good selection of fruits and veggies, as well as toiletries (shampoos, soaps, toothpaste, tampons, shaving creams, etc.) to household cleaning products. The frozen section is also very diverse with a good selection of frozen meals, ice cream (dairy and nondairy), and veggies. The Co-op also carries a nice selection of foods for people with restricted diets especially for Celiac and vegans, or for people with severe allergies like myself. \n\nThey also carry hard to find vegan cheeses such as Treeline that I have difficulty finding at WF in Pittsburgh and the Co-op in West Virginia. I was also happy to find that they had my favorite Ito-En sencha green tea shot (it's just green tea in a can, it's not like one of those energy shots at all). \n\nThe deli is also fantastic, and I highly recommend the Co-op deli over the WF deli. There are a wide variety of soups and salads and dressings. The vegan mushroom soup is really, really, really yummy. There are also vegan meals in ready to go containers (salads, vegan pesto noodle salad, etc.). You can also order coffee/espresso at the deli counter. As with any good Co-op, they have a variety of non-dairy milk options. \n\nIf you have food allergies or have any dietary restrictions the Co-op is an excellent place to get a quick meal (hot or cold) and to pick up groceries. There is also a little dining/sitting area at the front of the store. It's kid friendly and they even have a little compost/recycling bin! Yes, this is important for me to mention because I come from Seattle where recycling is the norm and we get fined if we don't recycle..and recycling does not seem to be a big thing in WV where I currently live. \n\nThere is also a community board if you are looking to post something up (events, classes, pet sitting, etc.) near the bathroom in the back of the store."
-1,Worst climbing gym I have ever been to. Customer service was a joke. Wall appears as if a boy scout went ham with a few sheets of plywood back in the 80s and then did nothing since then. Holds are prehistoric and grimy. Setting is subpar. Insurance doesn't allow for people who can't belay to be belayed? Better off climbing the outside of the building for a good pump..
1,"For 30 bucks a month, this is a pretty rad spot. I've climbed all over the US and Canada, but I'm happy to call this my home gym."
-1,"Service was okay, at best. I wouldn't go there again.  They quoted me at thousands of dollars of repairs for my car to pass inspection.  I took it somewhere else and had it done for a fraction of the quote."
-1,"The art museum is pretty nice; the carriage and car museum is cool; and it's neat to walk through the greenhouse.  Those are free.  However, nothing really separates the $12 house tour from other house tours.  Like the other ones, the docents don't focus on anything interesting, like history or the architecture or the building itself.  They focus on some family story that may only be of passing interest because the family is rich.  Kind of like hearing about Paris Hilton or the Kardashians.  B-o-r-i-n-g. And what kind of tourist attraction doesn't allow pictures?"
1,"I've been going to Izzazu for a very long time, almost 7 years now. I have ALWAYS gone to Cesare and will never stray from him! The first time I went into him, I was 18 years old and had some crazy red, blond and black hair. He really helped me go back to my natural color without damaging my hair (even with color stripping!) \n\nHe always knows exactly what I want, but isn't afraid to give me suggestions to liven up my look. He literally does the best color and cut in the city. And believe me, I've done some crazy stuff with my hair with a lot of hair dressers. \n\nThe atmosphere is very hip/chic and makes me feel like a celebrity when I go there!\n\nAlso, I LOVE their product line. I still only use Izzazu leave-in conditioner, hairspray and dry shampoo, even while spending over half of my year away from Pittsburgh at school.\n\nThe loss of one star goes to the attitude at reception. I understand it has compelled people to give them 1 star, but it IS a salon, meant for cosmetic services. You aren't going there for the reception. But, It wouldn't hurt them to smile or be a little less brash."
-1,"Maybe I went on a bad night, but the service was stunningly bad.  Water glasses stayed empty for almost 15 minutes!  Ordered 5 dishes, all pretty average.  The tab:  $300+.  I won't be back."
1,"Incredible experience up here, I would have to say that this goes down as one of my most memorable dining experiences in Pittsburgh for a number of reasons. I personally love this style of Italian cooking. Sicilian, so folks who are not familiar should take look at their menu online before coming because it might catch you off guard, it isn't what the \""normal\"" Italian restaurant offers. \n\nI had a great experience dodging potholes on my way through the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh which it makes it much more awarding arriving with my wheels of my vehicle still in alignment. They have valet parking which is great because it takes the stress out of trying to find parking.\n\nUpon entering I almost fainted at the smells and views of this place. Right when I walked in I saw an array of freshly prepared vegetables that were on a table in the kitchen area. It was beautiful and really made realize right then what kind of place this was. The service we had was second to none. Right from entering we were promptly seated and received an explanation of everything that was on the table for our enjoyment. The \""Holy Oil\"" was ridiculous and almost addicting I couldn't stop drowning the fresh bread in that stuff that I think I ruined my appetite.  Folks when you come here don't eat lunch because the food dishes are huge. We ordered an appetizer of Mussels Diavolo which had a huge amount of decent mussels in a spicier tomato sauce. The sauce was really spicy and flavorful that I couldn't waste it so I asked for more bread and took care of that. I think I should have come here with more people because already it was too much and too good just for two people. \n\nThen be prepared after your salad there is a pasta course, which I probably could have done without because I was approaching topped off. The pasta was in a vodka sauce that I could have been happy with for my main dinner.\n\nI then ordered the Filet Mignon, which was hands down the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life to date. They cooked it to my request of medium spot on,and the chunk of filet was so large that I can't figure out how they cooked it so perfectly. Than it was covered in a red wine sauce with mushrooms that was savory to say the least. We both had to take most of our entrees home with us which was unfortunate because they were so awesome. Matter of fact I'm eating the side of bacon mashed potatoes this morning as I write this review.\n\nI did think that it might be hard to come here if you don't eat meat because the menu on this Friday night was meat-tastic. They probably could make a pasta dish without might to suit ones requests but I don't know for sure. Also I did think that the menu online was a little misleading as I thought that there would have been more pasta options on the particular night I was there. There was only one option when I was there and it had a sauce that contained two meats sausage and pork.\n\nI wish my bank account could handle more of this place, I will be back once I roll my wallet out of the ER. If anybody has any suggestions on how I can do this place more often please let me know!"
1,The Park House is a great place to drink. They have a very good beer selection and even though the kitchen is a 4 foot by 4 foot square behind the bar the food is really good. \n\nThey have all you can eat Popcorn and Peanuts so you will never be in want of something to snack on while drinking your favorite beer. \n\nThey have live bands several times a week my favorite being Tuesdays which often features local Blue Grass musicians.  \n\nThe down side to this place for me is that it's a little on the expensive side. They have a majority of their beers that are 6+ bucks a pint which a bit much. You can get some for $4.50 - $5  but it cuts your selection significantly. It definitely makes you think twice before going here often. I just wish all their beers were under $5 because I would probably try and go here more often.  \n\nOver all it's a great bar the owner is a nice guy and you're going to have a great time.
1,"I am a big fan of Max;;s for their local flair, real German food, and authentic Pittsburgh feeling. They did not sell out, are not overly commercialized, and should be supported for the long standing quality service to the city. Thanks, Max's."
1,"I had a week off from work recently.  I needed it to take a little break and I decided, what better way to get caught up on all the museums and cultural institutions in the 'Burgh?\n\nTo say that the Carnegie is THE Pittsburgh Cultural Institution is indeed an understatement and as I live in nearby Squirrel Hill, I am so happy to have it within walking distance.  Although the day I visited, I rode my bike and parked it all day.  (Note to Yelp'er Mike O. from Park Ridge, IL--I didn't wipe out this time!).\n\nI decided to spend the entire day at the Carnegie, and believe me it was worth it!  As Emily H. says, the Dinosaurs in their time was really worth it!  It went from being a stuffy, dull, \""stuffed and mounted\"" exhibit to being a really neat walk-through one.  The murals really give the exhibit a sense of time and place.  The exhibit shows how the plants, mammals, fish, and insects that surrounded them continue to evolve and create the biological diversity that surrounds us today.\n\nA long-time favorite of mine is the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems.  I've always loved the bright colors of the gems and could stand there for hours in hushed awe of these beautiful stones.  The museum just added the Wertz Gallery of Gems and Jewelry to the Hillman Hall.  The gallery has an extensive collection of birthstones, giving the history of each and how birthstones came to be.  The current special exhibit is the watches and timepieces from H.J. Heinz, including a stunning music box and watch piece.\n\nBut as much as I enjoy natural science, I really love art.  The Carnegie Museum of Art includes  American art from the late nineteenth century, French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, and European and American decorative arts.   The Heinz Architectural is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models.  I particularly enjoy Asian art and the Carnegie has an extensive collection of Japanese prints.  \n\nOne special exhibit that I really recommend will be there only until October 18, 2008 and it is \""Abstract Art before 1950: Watercolors, Drawings, Prints, and Photographs\"".  It consists of avant-garde works by European, American, and Japanese artists.  \n\nSo while the admission fee is $15.00, it does include both the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Art.  To get your money's worth, plan on staying a whole day.  I did and I still feel like I didn't see everything."
-1,"At this point, I am done. I scheduled my kids for the last 2 weeks in August and then due to an emergency, I had to cancel, which I did a month before their camp was to start. I was told they were issuing my refund, and that was 3 weeks ago. THREE WEEKS and i still dont have it. I live probably 30 minutes from the museum and could have driven there 63838484848485858 times by now and picked it up. Its just sooo unprofessional and annoying. They need to get their office together and deliver refunds in a timely manner. 7-10 business days are fine but 3 WEEKS is UNACCEPTABLE for it to not have even been MAILED YET. So dissapointed and will never use them again."
1,OK so another winner in this neighborhood besides Nicky's.  The Penna Parma was outstanding and the Parm crusted salmon over whole wheat artichoke ravioli with a white basil sauce on special tonight was a great combo and wonderfully executed.  Katie our server was professional AND personable and only added to our outstanding meal.....then there were the Pittsbugh natives seated nearby who were friendly and delightful to visit with.   WOW what a place.  The only downside is that its a little tight inside and a little loud but don't let that stop you!  Well worth the trip!
-1,"Its okay, but it was just ok.  \n\nThere's a $4 per person corking fee which caught us off guard.  We were expecting that would be for the table.\n\nWe started with the polenta and the mozzarella.  The mozzarella was unremarkable, deep friend mozzarella in breading.  Of course it was good, it is fried cheese!  But it was nothing special.  The polenta was a real stand out, tasted home made and was delicious.\n\nThey give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil.  This was free so I'm not complaining, but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me.  Also, the breadsticks were covered in rosemary, and I loathe rosemary.\n\nMy friend had the special, pan seared shrip over pesto penne, and she loved it.  I had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright.  It was good but I felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent.\n\nOverall I would come here again but maybe I'd stick with a staple like chicken parmigana."
1,"Those who know, know this is the place to buy your cases of beer. The prices are low and the tax is included in the price tag, but the best reason to shop here is Sam. He is a character, knows a lot about beer and is a really nice guy.  First time we stopped by, he invited us into his shop and stock area and we talked for quite a while before departing with some real good beer.  Sam Caruso has a story for almost every occasion and  the beer to match each occasion. A real Pittsburgh place."
-1,"This Giant Eagle maybe the worst supermarket I've ever been to. There are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot. The interior is dark and dank and has an outdated \""made in the 70s\"" feel. With options like this I don't have a problem taking the extra time to drive to Trader Joe's."
-1,"The only reason to shop here is that going anywhere else is out of your way. The prices our worse than other GE stores and I wonder why. The produce is not very fresh and the meats never looks good . The store never looks very clean. I was hopeful a couple of years ago when the store was refurbished and it was nicer for a while but now it's back to it's old ways. I have friends that refuse to go there because of the scary parking lot where people sell \""things\"" out of their cars and at the driveway exit. If there is outside cameras, the Pgh police should take a look. I wish there was an alternative to shop in the northside. Kuhns off Brighton rd is about the same except the prices are better."
-1,"This is a small, franchise-owned location that caters to the predominantly low income households in the area. Selection is quite limited throughout the store with limited quantities on the shelf of the items they do carry. Because of the area in which it is located, the store is NOT 24-hours as most Giant Eagle's seem to be. \n\nThe pharmacy inside the store, unlike the store itself, is corporate owned, and it's staff is friendly and efficient. A stark contrast to the rest of the store.\n\nOnce again reflecting the relatively low income of the area this store serves, there will be one of more jitney's (unlicensed cabs, effectively) waiting outside the store willing to take you and your groceries home for a small fee. \n\nIn general, if you CAN shop somewhere else, you will probably want to."
1,"This place is great! The wait, pushy counter person, and unattended children are an easy overlook when I finally leave with the best fill and nail art I've ever had! Lisa was super quick, had me drying in less than 15 minutes of sitting down in her chair! I found the nail art I wanted (she copied it perfectly, by the way) on pintrest, but just as I sat down, my phone died. She pulled out her charger, AND CHARGED MY PHONE. Where else has anyone done this? Nowhere. Lisa actually made conversation, and she was easy to understand. I will be back in two weeks for another fill! \n\nJust a heads up, go early, if you can, as it gets closer to close, more and more people line up. :) it's so worth the wait, though!!"
-1,"I have a dream. A dream that some day the North Shore will have a ton of amazing food options. I hope one day it will become a reality. For now, I think there's a smattering of okay-ish places and a lot of mediocrity. \n\nMaybe it's just the built in crowd. You come to a game, you gotta eat, right? And what are you going to eat? Either at a restaurant outside the stadium or inside. At this point I'd stick with inside for the novelty of it all. \n\nI stopped into Atria's on game day, but came in right as the first pitch was going out, so it wasn't packed in the least. Our server was obviously not into us, as well as serving that day, as she was pretty short with us the entire time. Sorry we bothered you...\n\nThe menu is incredibly limited with around 5 apps, 5 sandwiches and 5 main courses. I get that they're probably just limiting things for the crowded times, but I felt like nothing really called to me. I settled on going halfies and ordering an app and waiting until I was inside the stadium to get my \""main course.\"" Crab fries, naturally. But that's beside the point.\n\nThe pieorgies we ordered were okay. They were doused in Parmesan cheese and a little overcooked, but it wasn't the worst thing I've ever had. Wasn't the best either. I think what really turned me off was the whole experience. Service, small selection and mediocre food. I should have just ordered two buckets of crab fries and called it a night!"
-1,"When you walk into a buzzing restaurant, you'd expect to be greeted by someone, be that a server, a greeter or the bartender. I went in last night, stood around for almost 10 minutes, and was completely ignored. I was meeting a few friends, so I decided to walk across the street and grab a beer and make a reservation (using open table) for 45 minutes later.  Reservation confirmed, and beer finished, I walk back over, walk in to the place and someone's at the computer in the entryway on the phone. He finishes, we make eye contact, he nods and walks away. My friends come in, we wait 10 minutes for someone who works there to talk to us. I tell her we have reservations, she acts like it can't happen, and that it's my mistake, she says that the place is closed for a private party. I ask why there isn't a sign on the door saying 'closed for private party', and I get a ridiculous answer that the \""CEO doesn't like us to do that\"". How dumb is that: you leave your system open to make reservations and you don't alert people that might be going to a show on the north shore that the place is closed. The fake sincerity is what really got me. You know what a 'private party' sign does? It advertises that you are available for private parties, and would have given me an hour to figure out other arrangements."
0,"A brick wood-fired smoker with a cast iron door, a stainless steel prep table with cutting boards, cooler case, a cash register, and a man who has been tending the coals well beyond your time.\n\nWilson's is what a great BBQ place should be.  Simple. \n\nThere is no sense in overanalyzing what Mr. Wilson has been doing here for years.  He's not a competition circuit smoker, not a modern restaurateur spreading his seed across Pittsburgh, and certainly no hipster chef serving ingredients grown in his rooftop garden.\n\nRibs. Chicken. Sauce.\n\nThe slow smoked spare ribs, sold by the plate size or full rack, are smoked just long enough to make the rib bones protrude from the top of the slab but not long enough so the meat is \""falling off the bone\""... tender and juicy, but enough bite to let you know that you're eating the flesh off an animal.  The color and texture of the surface aren't overwhelming in flavor but give you just enough crust and seasoning to let you experience the strata of bark / meat / fat.  For those that don't like fat, you'll complain about the ribs.  Spares have a tendency to hold a bit more fat within the meat fibers, particularly the section around the tips that are usually trimmed for a St. Louis cut.  you want low fat? Eat a pork loin or a handful of grass.\n\nThe chickens are halved and smoked right alongside the ribs. The skin had nice chew, a good simple rub, and cooked beyond the point of any gummy texture but not so long that it was a layer of armor surrounding the meat.  The dark meat was succulent and the white meat maintained just the right amount of moisture.\n\nAs requested, everything was served with the hot BBQ sauce.  Not mind blowingly hot, but a well rounded picquant flavor with a bit of black pepper on the tip of the tongue.  Tomato base with a bit of vinegar, good enough to compliment the meat and fat of both animals.\n\nAs for sides, the collard greens are tender and you'll come across the occasional gold nugget of pork.  The coleslaw and macaroni salad are simple and a bit underseasoned, but when eaten in tandem with the meat and sauce they compliment everything just fine.  Mr. Wilson also caps off an order with the true stamp of great bbq... white bread. A vessel to mop up all the rib shrapnel swimming in the pool of sauce at the bottom of your styrofoam container.\n\nIt's not the cleanest, it's not the classiest... why?  It's a rib shack in an old house that's been here for going on 53 years.  It may not be the best barbecue you'll ever eat, but in a city with new restaurants popping up every week that all try to outduel each other with trendy ingredients, it's nice to know that I can walk in through an old screen door and be slapped in the face with a stiff breeze of smoking pork... without having to worry about anyone selling me small portion size, extravagant presentation, and a list of 35 ingredients to compose a single dish."

1,"I'm not a car girl and Lester couldn't have been more accommodating.  I needed an inspection and he was able to take me the same day I called.  He's open past 7pm so the evening hours make it convenient to pick up or drop off. \n\nVery honest and upfront about the work he did, too...typical Pittsburgher who knows his stuff. Labor was $70/hour and parts were cheaper than other places. Cost me $3 to have a break light replaced.  Couldn't have been happier with the quick, honest, convenient service.  Lester's the best!"

1,Nick's has legit New York Style pizza.  It's dirt cheap too!
-1,"After seeing a Google Offer for Miller's, my Mom mentioned how she had been there before and remembered good food and fond memories from her childhood.  So I offered to go with her and see if the food was still as good.  \n\nOnce we were seated and greeted by our waitress, we presented the paperwork for our Google Offer.  The waitress handed it to the hostess.  I guess they have to call for us to redeem it/verify that it's legit.  Well apparently one of the numbers was missing off the print-out and the hostess could not have been more rude about it.  In the end she talked to someone and figured it out, but she made it seem like we did something wrong.  Or, she could have told us there was a problem but then politely taken care of it since it is her job and there wasn't much else going on for her to do.  Or she could have talked to someone in the first place and quietly resolved the matter without us even knowing there was a problem to begin with.  I later noticed signs up all over the place about restrictions with restaurant.com offers - I guess they have several patrons who use those regularly.  Apparently with this kind of reception, no one wants to pay full price.\n\nMom and I both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese.  The mac n cheese was creamy and the fish sandwich was a large portion and very tasty.  I ended up having to eat mine with a knife and fork, not even attempting to lift and eat it as a sandwich.  We left with full and happy tummies.\n\nTo comment on previous reviews....yes, this is not the cleanest place.  But I expected that and find it part of the charm.  The smoke from the bar is no longer an issue as a closed door separates the bar area from the dining room.\n\nOverall, it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich.  I'd like to give it 3 stars at least, but the whole attitude from the hostess still left a bad taste in my mouth that the mac n cheese couldn't wash away."
1,People and company make mistakes. \nThe owner personally took responsibility for the mistake and fixed the problem. \n\nThis shows they care about their customers and value the business!!

-1,"you can't beat a fairly centrally-located grocery store that is open 24-7 BUTTT the smell in there is ughhh.  Years and years of spilled food / blood from the meat department and etc.    You get the picture .    The high-point is perhaps the hot foods that you can get over in the deli.-area.  Some really good \""soul-food\"" .  Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and etc... I will go out of my way for that stuff, sometimes ..."
-1,"Another ugly haircut like everywhere in Pittsburgh. For $60 with the owner. Trusted the reviews, but now look like a Pittsburgh redneck. No hair on the sides and long on the back!"
1,Had lunch with my wife. The quality of the sushi was quite good. My wife had some tempura that was fabulous. Service was friendly and quick. We really enjoyed our lunch. We will be back.
-1,"Below par diner food. Fried zucchini is all breading and no zucchini. Anything fried always comes dripping in grease, I know, I know it's diner food but it doesn't have to be so greasy it makes you physically ill. I'm a big fan of blt's and there's is pretty poor. Small portion with very little meat and dry bread.\n\nBesides the food, the service is so so. Last time I was in I asked for a lemonade and the waitress forgot it, asked for mayo and there was none on my sandwich, and this was on a slow day\n\nWith eat n park down the street and Pamela's not too far away it seems you have much better places to get you're grub on. I'm giving it one star because I can't see myself ever coming back or recommending the place to anyone else."
1,Excellent and made from scratch !!!!
-1,This was just bad pizza.  For the money I expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza.  The cheese and pepparoni were added after the crust came out.  Also the mushrooms were out of a can.  Do not waste money here.
1,"Darren it cracked me up to see you reviewed this Eat'n Park, but then I wasn't surprised a bit. I used to live blocks away from this place, and the location was ideal, for my favorite bar ever (Wilkie's Inn, now closed) was diagonally across the street from it. I actually have mostly bad memories of drunken friends fighting and/or confrontations here, but still this place beats all after a night at the bar. I can close my eyes and picture scrambled eggs and french toast, not to mention their delicious burgers with a side of pickles. And of course the obligatory Eat'n Park smiley face cookies, ah how I love them! Message to non-Pittsburghers, go to this (or any) Eat'n Park at least once! You'll be back!"
1,"We go here quite often for lunch. The food is excellent. Service is friendly, but spotty. If your in a hurry for lunch, I would advise you call ahead. I think perhaps the time it takes is because food is made to order. A great thing for the quality and taste but not so much if you have a limited amount of time. The lunch specials are a fantastic deal, and no matter what else I get , I get the spinach salad. It's scrumptious. Definitely recommend this place. Dinner I have had a couple times and the food was good, but the lunch deals are awesome!"
-1,"Found the place to be average at best. Pancakes were not very good. They tasted like they were made from a mix, mushy in the middle, and they came with powdered sugar which I don't like (wish the server told me beforehand). Average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive. OJ was pretty bad as well- like the cheap stuff you get from the grocery store. I like the fact the place is not a chain, and I'd be up for trying other food there, but from my experience the pancakes do not live up to the hype."
-1,"The Hype surrounding this place will probably lead to your great disappointment.  We moved in to the neighborhood, and all we heard was Campiti's this Campiti's that, and how it is without a doubt, the best pizza in the Burgh.\n\nSo, of course we tried it, and were pretty excited to do so. Now I have lived in several different Pittsburgh neighborhoods, and you always find the pizza you like where you live. Campiti's pizza is not the pizza I like. I wouldn't order a pizza from them again.\n\nHonestly, it was about up to a frozen pizza standard. Now, I'm not saying they are making frozen pizzas, they aren't but, I have even had better frozen pizzas than the pizza we got from Campiti's.\n\nAnother reviewer hit the nail on the head saying people who say this is the best pizza around probably have some long running emotional attachment to this place That can be he only logical reason that people actually say it.\n\n."
-1,Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!
-1,"Sadly really went downhill. They switched to a new vendor, the prices went up and they are no longer having sales."
0,"The pizza is great. Other food items might disappoint. They do deliver! Service is hit and miss. There is one rude,  smile-less bartender... I have actually seen him through the window and decided to go somewhere else because I was in the mood for good service."
-1,"I guess that I sport a very simple haircut and like to keep it that way. Unfortunately, the person who cut my hair here must have slipped with the razor just behind my ear and tried to make it look normal by cleaning it up and making the other side look the same. Since I don't typically look at myself for extended periods of time, I actually didn't notice until last night when I was washing my hands in a resteraunt bathroom.  I will be speaking with manager come Monday. \n\nI had no wait and the lady who can't cut my simple hair do was very nice, until she didn't say oops I sort of f*'d your hair up. It isn't really bad and I'm not horribly upset but it IS noticeable! It would have been nice if she said something to me about it. I think this warrants a refund of my money. I will let you all know if I got my money back."
1,"Lovely floral arrangements for every occasion.  Her boutonnieres and corsages are lovely and inexpensive - she must have made dozens for me and my friends during high school.  You cannot beat the service here.  When students at the elementary school up the street come in wanting flowers for their teachers, she will provide them with the best for only $1 or $2.  Blooming Dahlia is the best example of hometown service I could imagine."
-1,"The service is not that amazing, it's almost as if they don't care to have a business. I've dealt with them for large orders and while meeting the deadlines they request, it's never enough. They usually don't have your requested kegs and will tell you to order earlier (which by experience still does not help). \n\nThe saving grace is likely for individual sales. From the times I've had go to the store to pick up our \""deliveries\"" (ie. nearly every time), it looked like they had a decent selection from the wall for cases...but who knows if they actually carry the selection."
0,"D's does the chicago style hot dog very well, they even use sport peppers which I can never find in the grocery store. The bun is steamed and features the quintessential poppy seed exterior.\n\nD's beer selection is also great but I'm not much of a beer drinker so it's not something I've ever focused on. The general consensus I've heard is that there is better selection elsewhere and the prices are a little high but you can't beat both their hot dogs and their beer selection at the same time, making them a great bar.\n\nTheir fries are so crispy that I suspect they're double fried. They're tasty and the toppings available can turn them into a bastard concoction of delicious, artery clogging glory. There's been nothing on D's menu that I've been disappointed with.\n\nThe service can be a little hit or miss due mostly to the sheer amount of business they do on a Friday or Saturday night."
-1,"I don't understand the hype for D's, although I guess their beer selection *does* rule.  If selection drives your decision-making, definitely head on over.  However, if you'd like to receive anything other than slow, resentful service from your waitstaff, or food that is anything above sub-par, head on by without stopping.  I've lived just down Forbes from D's for 3 yrs, and walk down there with friends a lot during the summer and early fall.  I'm also a former bartender and waitress, so I can say with experience and certainty that I've received just downright terrible service there about 80% of the times I've been.  Once, a friend and I stopped in for lunch with her kids and ended up waiting for the check 18 minutes after we'd asked to receive it.  We were both fuming, and the waitress just looked annoyed and kept ignoring us to chat with her buddy.  Another time, my husband and I came in 15 minutes before the ordering deadline, and watched as the waitress did not approach our table until exactly the cut-off time.  She proudly announced that we could no longer order food (we just wanted pretzels, for god's sake).  Food is pretty lackluster, although it's a nice touch that they have veggie dogs.  Upstairs, expect about the same level of service, with a douchy element of annoyed resentment from the bartender, along with even douchy-ier clientele. \n\nI know D's is a favorite neighborhood place, but I'm tired of the abuse from waitstaff who look annoyed that I'm even there.  If this was just a once-in-a-while occurrence, I'd be forgiving, but 3 years is long enough to judge."
1,What a place. What a selection.  I love it.  \n\nThis place allows you to view hundreds of beers from around the world.  You can buy mixed six packs as well. \n\nThe food is great and service is just fine.
-1,"The place smells awful.   Its non-smoking, but reeks of stale smoke, and when I spend 1/2 an hour there, I leave smelling like smoke.  This isn't an isolated incident, but it really smells every time I've been in there (at least once a month for the past couple years).\n\non the up side: decent coffee, decent assorted snacks (pastries, sandwiches, etc.), great location."
-1,"My guess is that \""Ruth K.\"" was put up to writing a nice review by the staff or owner.  Regent Square deserves a better coffee shop, run by someone with good business sense.  What kind of a \""business\"" only prepares food (chicken/tuna salad, hummus) once a week?  Does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge?  Also, whenever they lose an employee, they just shuffle their schedule and close at 6 pm for a few months.  They should be open till 10 pm as it is, with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood, especially in the summer. My guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door.   Otherwise you would think that since opening in 1995 they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the place!\n\nBTW, Katerbean did go smoke free before the Allegheny County ordinance went into effect, but the place to this day reeks of stale smoke.\n\nAdded note: looks like my previous review was somehow deleted.  I'll just say I received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it.  Tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition. I asked for a refund, and afterwards watched the kid working there put the other containers back in the cooler to sell to other customers. That was the last straw.  I won't spend another dollar there."
1,"MUCH nicer since the renovation! The only thing I don't love is that there are rarely baskets near the entrance, and it's weird how you have to go through the whole produce area to get to the rest of the store!\n\nCheckers are usually friendly here, and good selection and variety."
-1,"Nothing special, it is Kmart after all.  \n\nDeals are hard to come by, but you have to just look a little bit longer.  It is true that the employees really don't seem to care that they are at work.  I can relate, I did my time in retail.  Although I left it when my time was due.  \n\nGood for the area if you don't want to run to a nearby shopping area."
0,Spent the weekend and Pittsburgh and started out Friday night at Mad Mex for Happy Hour and some dinner. Happy Hour was a pretty good deal with half price wings and cheap drafts. The wings were good and the beer selection is above average.\n\nFor dinner I had the carnitas enchiladas (i think). It didn't taste bad but I definitely had better Mexican elsewhere even elsewhere in Pittsburgh.
1,"Stopped by with my laptop late last Friday afternoon to enjoy some craft brews and prep for a class I'm teaching Saturday morning.  Normally I have nothing but great things to say about Mad Mex in Scott Town Center, but I was mildly annoyed by a new server who seemed to abandon me after finding out I wished to stay and work after purchasing my meal and buying several craft brews.  This is not the normal treatment at this establishment for the guy at table #28 with the laptop.  In any case, great food & great selection of microbrews!"
0,"I'm always the first to say that I love Mad Mex.  I don't care that it's Tex Mex, just give me a supersized Dance Marathon Enchilada and I'm in dance party heaven!  \n\nWhat I was sad about at this location was the gauc,.  It was, how do you say....okay...it was just plain gross.  It tasted rotten!  Not the way you want your gauc to taste.  And for some reason I kept torturing myself by taking little bites to see what the heck was wrong with it!  The waitress, who was incredibly nice, took it back to see what was up with it.  She said she thought maybe it had too much lime in it.  I love lime and I don't really know how lime can make gauc taste rotten, but I was pretty bummed \n\nThe good?  My Dance Marathaon Enchilada, as always, was a party in my mouth!  And like I said, our waitress was super friendly and a great server!  She suggested to the seasonal Apple Cider Margarita.  I excited and scared all at once!  I've been digging the ciders lately, but in a marg?  A little scary.  First sip tasted a bit like cinnamon apple sauce.  A tad weird.  A couple sips later, I was into it.  I was also into caramel/sugar lining the rim of the glass!  \n\nSolid meal, I just missed the fresh, non weird tasting, gauc.  Until next time...practice safe Mex everyone!"
0,"This location has such a different feel than the others around Pittsburgh. Perhaps it's the well-lit bar, or maybe it's that there's a new bartender every time I make it over here. In any case, it doesn't quite have the \""feel\"" that North Hills and Robinson have."
0,Parking = terrible\nService = just ok\nFood = decent\nAtmosphere = really nice but loud\nDrinks = margaritas are ok\n\nComing here I wouldn't get anything else other than the burritos it fajitas. Really disappointed in the quesadilla I had here. Guacamole is pretty bland but the salsa has a nice spicy kick. Neat place to hang out if in the mood for Mexican like food and atmosphere.
0,"I do like my Mad Mex, however predictable and non-authentic it may be.  The portion sizes are mammoth and I come away with a satisfied sense of regret.  Their beer menu is happily extensive.  Charging me $9 for chips and salsa is a bit of crime, wouldn't ya say though!?!  I mean, c'mon!  Our service has most times been lacking--a bit rushed and on the inattentive side.  Also, why do you require your wait staff to not servestraws/ lemons/etc unless asked by cusotmers---weirdness-cut out these odd cost-cutting, anti-service friendly measures please."
0,Grabbed a couple of dozen bagels and took to work.  Man they don't last long.  Bagels are good and the service is friendly.  They were real busy but make time to chat will working.
0,"The close-to-my-childhood-home Starbucks: it's A. Not Peet's, and B. An accidental high school reunion when I dare to venture in. On the other hand, there are usually couches--or chairs and tables--available, inside or outside, depending on the season.\n\nThis is the option when I don't want to try to park on Beverly for a caffeine fix at the Coffee Tree."
0,"This is exactly what I was looking for in a hotel during my one night stay in Pittsburgh. Close to the city, but far enough out to get free parking and a reasonable rate (under $100).\n\nThe room was fairly small, but I was only planning on sleeping in it. It was clean so I couldn't ask for much more. The people at the front desk were very friendly too.\n\nIf I go back to Pittsburgh, I will absolutely stay here again."
1,"We are new to the area. We bought a 100 year old home in the Dormont suburb of Pittsburgh and set about to do a serious renovation. The moment we walked into Ceramiche we knew we were in good hands. Tina, Bob, Melissa, Suzy and Nicky all know their stuff and treat us like long lost friends. The selection of tile is the best we have found in this area and the prices are very good. The service is what really makes this place special."
1,"Great bagels, sandwiches, soup, and coffee!\nMy favorites are the veg-out bagel sandwich, the bagel dog on onion, and their sour cream potato salad is so good too.\nIf you like all beef hotdogs, you should try the bagel dog. They wrap bagel around the dog. When they heat it up, the juice soaks into that chewy bagel and it is heaven.  Mmm."
1,A good Starbucks.  There is always a line at this one due to it's location but they do a great job of getting people served quickly.  Today I had a salted camel mocha.  It was pretty amazing.\n\nThis location also has a fireplace which is a nice touch for cold days.
0,"Ok so my first experience at princess nails could be described as slightly awkward but totally worth it. When I went into the salon I didn't realize how cramped it actually was it didn't look too clean to be honest. But anyway I had called earlier in the week to see if they took appointments and they told me they didn't so I walked in to get my eyebrows waxed. When I arrived I said what I wanted done not knowing that I had to sit further up near the waxing chair to be waited on next before some woman cut ahead of me. But when I actually did get my eyebrows waxed by this older asian woman who went by michelle I believed she did a fantastic job of thinning out my eyebrows and surprisingly after telling her \""thinner\"" 5 times she made them absolutely stunning and for only 10 dollars. Although its not much to look at when you go in getting my eyebrows waxed at Princess Nails was the best decision I ever made.\n\n*NOTE* My rating is based on Eyebrow Waxing. Unfortunately I do not get my nails done. EVER. So please keep in mind when reading my review for this location that it is solely based on my experience with waxing and waxing ONLY."
1,Like I said before in my first post about Princess Nails. Its definitely dingy and and as hole in the wall as you can get. But Michelle oh my is this woman amazing. Second visit to get my eyebrows waxed was just as worthwhile as the first. ASK FOR MICHELLE. I'm not going to rate this 5 stars simply because of the lack of cleaniness BUT what would they do without Michelle.\n\n*NOTE* My rating is based on Eyebrow Waxing. Unfortunately I do not get my nails done. EVER. So please keep in mind when reading my review for this location that it is solely based on my experience with waxing and waxing ONLY.
1,"I went to M.C.N salon because I had seen positive reviews on Yelp. I have to say the reviews were right. It was one of the best salon experiences I've ever had. The salon itself is beautiful and very inviting. The receptionist was so warm and genuinely friendly. I recently changed stylists for something new which I was wary of  doing.  I decided to try one of their junior stylists, Elizabeth. Everyone should go to see her! She gives a great first impression which is reassuring because nothing makes me more nervous than a stylist who is not put together or whose haircut and/or color is whack. \n\n I came in a hot mess and I left feeling and looking a 100% better. My hair is really thick and was driving me crazy in the heat. She did a great job thinning it out and giving me layers without sacrificing length. My head literally felt lighter. Plus, the blow out she gave me was so glamorous. I've never seen my hair look like that before! She was really patient and explained the products and how she was styling my hair. I would recommend her to anyone. She's really professional and great at her job!"
1,"You've got to book with Liz!\n\nIf you have curly hair (or even not) she is the best in the burgh.  Nails it every time.  Love her personality and attention to detail.  I really feel like she listens to what I want but will tell me what she thinks, in a kind way. She's energetic, attentive, and just really knows hair.  \n\nHave been back multiple times and each time I leave happy: cut, color, and all.  Probably the first time i've actually stuck with a stylist.  Thanks Liz!"
-1,"Today, I definitely didn't have a great experience at MCN. I got my haircut couple months ago from there and I liked it, so I decided to go again for coloring today.\nI wasn't happy about it at all -cuz I can still see the line btw my root and the bottom. PLUS, they charged me 25 bucks more for the blow-dry without telling me. I wish I didnt go there for the color.."
0,"4th of July... everything is packed so of course there was a wait, for a table of 12.  There really wasn't anywhere to actually wait, and even though many of us ordered from the bar, we got the distinct feeling that we were not welcome to linger while waiting for our table, so we were in the way of the wait staff no matter where we tried to cram ourselves.  \n\nThe food was good though.  I had a buffalo chicken wrap and it was good.  However, someone at our table was charged for extra ketchup... what is that about?!  Glad I didn't ask for extra buffalo sauce as usual.  \n\nDespite these issues, we were served in a timely fashion and the food was better than I expected because of the reviews.  It is pricier than it should be for the quality but still better than I expected."
0,"Just your typical hotel-restaurant. \n\nThey offer great happy hour and daily drink specials. \n\nAtmosphere was nice. Part restaurant, part sports bar. \n\nFood was average. Had the shrimp-crab bisque to start, which was easily the best thing I had that night. Then did a French dip sandwich for dinner, as there wasn't many \""dinner\"" choices that intrigued me, and also the precious reviews of dinner dishes weren't good. Sandwich wasn't very good, typical bar cuisine though. Girlfriend had the chicken broccoli pasta, which was excessively cheesy. \n\nOverall, it's not bad, but won't knock your socks off. It certainly benefits by the lack of other restaurants near it."
1,"Came in on Monday for some pre concert drinks and dinner. We were greeted nicely at the door and got sat in a booth, which I love :) our server was Jess, she was very nice and attentive to all of our needs. I was never there before and she helped me pick out drinks from the menu and had great recommendations.  We had Mac and cheese bites as an app, so good!! Then for dinner I had the turkey club and my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken wrap, all very yummy :) she even brought me a small sample of the black bean salad I was wondering about for the sides. The few different people who ran the food to our table were very pleasant also, a very nice staff all around. We had a nice time and would definitely go back again !!! :)"
-1,"I am not a big fan of seafood so it takes a lot to win me over.\n\nI tried several of the dishes at Original Fish Market including the lobster bisque, the halibut, and the pork-chop with coleslaw.  The lobster bisque was bland and cold.  The halibut was decent.  The pork chop was so bitter and dry.\n\nThe whole atmosphere of the place seemed standoff-ish and was not friendly.  Furthermore, it took forever just to get our waitress's attention.  When we finally got her to look our way, she was short with us.  It was as if we bothered her.  I would rather go get sushi than spend more money here."
-1,"For a place that has a $75 entree I was pretty shocked to see a $2 charge for blue cheese olives on my bill... pretty tacky.   That was definitely a first.  I was disappointed the waitress didn't say anything either. Aside from that the service was pretty good... and the sashimi was a great value.  But everything else about this place is shwag.  The seared tuna - garbage, rainbow roll and Caesar salad - weak,  and the sides incredibly small.  The place has the feel of a riverboat buffet.  If this was stand alone they would only get away with charging 40% of what they are now... in the Westin.\nI would skip it, or if you have to, get sashimi at the bar and make sure you review your bill."
0,"The restaurant is located in the lobby of the Westin.  I was staying at the hotel but avoided the restaurant given that it was less than 3 stars on YELP.  The last night, I was tired and worked until 9PM, so decided to give it a try.\n\nThe menu itself is good.  They have seafood and sushi and there were plenty of dishes that caught my eye, though settled on a couple of sushi rolls.\n\nThe sushi rolls were good, and they have a good draught beer selection.  From a food perspective, I would give it a 3.5 stars, approaching four, but then I only had the sushi.  Still, just based on food, I'll try it again.\n\nHowever, where it may get a bad reputation is service, which isn't very good.  The bar was about half full, otherwise the restaurant was at most 10% occupied.  Still, anyone sitting at the bar had to wave to the bartender to get his attention, and it took about 25 minutes for my two rolls to come out.  That might explain the 2.5 star rating.\n\nSince I'll likely be staying at this Westin for awhile, probably will try it again."
-1,"I never ate here nor could have possibly gotten a drink no one would wait on me.\n\nMy friend who wanted to be a socialite of some kind asked me to come with her. I don't know what she was thinking. Not my scene whatsoever! We had come from a free Devo concert. I was dressed in converses,  a side pony tale, and bright pink 80's garb. \n\nI have never seen so many idiots occupying one space. The chicks looked at me like I was an alien. Not everyone needs to wear 5 inch heels, gobs of makeup, and clothes that is so tight that your breathing is impaired just to get a little cleavage popping out of a minuscule ugly dress.\n\n I like fashion, I love heals. It was the glassy, vapid, duplicates that I saw that made me give my friends a hug and kiss then seriously BOLT out the door! Super bad energy in this place. I jumped in the first cab I saw and headed to Lawrenceville. I didn't even say goodbye to the friend who had brought me there. Smoke bomb disappeared! She knew I would hate it but just didn't want to go alone. I was pissed.\n\nThe night was not lost. My awesome \""fiends\"" from LA (stunt man Curtze, and Elvis impersonator slash gangster screen writer) met me out and we dive bar-ed the rest of the evening away. I meant to write \""friends\"" but didn't change it because fiends, haha... much more appropriate. \n\nI am not saying that people who like this place are any particular sort. Some of my favorite people like Bossa Nova. Just stating my personal experience."
0,"Went on a Friday evening for cocktails. I ordered a gin martini, it was delicious. For a snack we ordered pan seared scallops in a strawberry basil sauce. We were so surprised when the huge sea scallops were put in front of us! They were cooked perfectly and the sauce was bright and fresh, and for only $12! \n\nThe reason I'm giving 3 stars is because of the atmosphere. This place is set up weird, and there were only 2 or 3 full tables in the \""dining room\"". The crowd was full of 40 somethings and there was a cover band, playing all the hits from the 70's and 80's. We didn't stay long."
1,"I always had a good experience eating here for lunch.  Yea it is a bit run down, but name some in the strip that aren't?  They have $5.00 lunch specials and Jimmy was always very nice and the huge stogies in his mouth just took me back.  Funny.. Highly recommend."
1,"The PAT buses aren't nearly as bad as many Pittsburghers make it to be. People complain about having to do transfers downtown, etc... - The reality is, it a decent system!! They could have more frequent rotations of buses at different routes, but Pittsburgh's public transportation - the buses, the T, etc... is a good system that works well for a city that is built on some mountains with a poor lay out of roads, etc... its not going to run as efficiently as areas that are built on a grid system that makes logical sense - its more difficult to get around everything. Gotta give them some slack!! and The bus drivers have always been great too!"
-1,"The only pro about Port Authority is it gets you from point a to point b. \n\nI've had buses that smell like pee. I've had buses where the bus drivers are yelling at drivers or people downtown. Screaming insults out the window.  Had a bus driver doing like 70mph down McKnight road. \nAt least twice a week I get a bus that's farebox is broke.  Yeah a free ride is nice but port authority is always crying wanting to increase their already ridiculous fare prices. Routes are always getting cut which leaves buses jam packed. \n\nThey introduce the connect card (an alternative to cash and passes. If I load $20.00 onto the card I should be able to get a transfer without entering cash the drivers don't know that and argue about it.  Feel free to train your employees. \n\nOn an 80 degree day one buses heat was on full blast. Not the drivers fault. He finally pulled over restarted the bus and it read 98 degrees before the air worked.\n\nBuses are late all the time.  When going to work I need to leave at least an hour before I should have to, to ensure I get to work on time. \n\nI can go on forever..."
-1,"If you like filthy buses, super high fares and about 50% rude operators then you will love Port Authority service.  Now if you like clean buses, reasonable fares and friendly service you will need to go somewhere else.  And no place for children as the language on the buses would make a sailor blush.  And in 14 years of riding Port Authority I have never seen a uniformed Port Authority officer riding a bus."
-1,Awful!!!\nNever EVER follows schedule! Lets you wait for literally over an hour on a bus that is supposed to be running every 15 min.
-1,"How is it port authority has the money to build a pointless over pass on the east liberty busway, but can't update their online system for smart phones to be able to determine where a bus is located at? I waited two hours today in the freeZing cold to get to work. Had to call off it was just to cold out!"
-1,"I must admit that not being from Pittsburgh, I walked into this place with very different expectations for what a \""cheesesteak\"" sandwich constituted. Having said that, while the inclusion of an enormous amount of fries and coleslaw on the sandwich was great, the tiny piece of beef \""patty\"" that can only be described as something they use as a weight watchers/jenny craig portion leaves much to be desired. I honestly felt like I was eating some sort of vegetarian sandwich with a tiny piece of shriveled up beef patty lost somewhere in between the enormous slices of Italian bread.\n\nOn the plus side, the Oakland location does have a pretty sweet deal for after 10pm, where a sandwich and drink was 3 or 4 bucks."
-1,"Primanti's sandwiches pretty much sum up Pittsburgh in many ways:  big, over-the-top, tasteless, and unhealthy.  What more could you ask for? Unfortunately, this place is pretty dirty.  Make sure no flies land on your food.\n\nIt seems like Pittsburgh natives love this place, which is fine.  Its food certainly is unique.  However, if you're not from Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll walk away with a rather bland taste in your mouth.\n\nBy the way, do not pronounce the \""t\"" in Primanti.  It really irks native Pittsburghers.  It's pronounced \""Primanny.\""  Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way."
-1,"Primanti Bros is basically the heart of all yinzers in Pittsburgh. However, I have to take primanti bros in doses. Their big ass sandwiches make me feel like I dont need to eat the rest of the week. Sometimes I love it for that and sometimes I hate it. Either way its a nice place to sit back, relax, and enjoy a nice cold beer with my friends. \n\n My only complaint about this particular primanti bros in market square is the people that it generates. Anywhere from hookers to crackheads. I have been in there several times and atleast 4 or 5 times I watched someone get kicked out for doing something illegal. My advice is, if you can, go to this primantis during the day for lunch dont go at night. If you can go to the one in the strip district or southside on 17th street."
1,"Tiny little place and very popular...highly suggest going early if you're a newbie in town and never had their sammiches before. They get pretty busy after 12.\n\nI couldn't decide what to get, and was told their number 2 popular choice is  not that great and I should try salami or black angus. Tough! So, I ended going with roast beef. I really enjoyed it, not greasy at all, and I actually ate the whole thing. Ha unbelievable, it was that good! \n\nOverall service was great."
1,"Have you ever watched them make this sandwich?  It's a special craft for sure.  They take two pieces of white Italian bread.  Pile on your choice of meat and cheese....then the grand finale....cole slaw and fries!  Then the put both hands on the sandwich and proceed to smoosh it all down flat. All this is done with their bare hands, no gloves here, so all you sanitary peeps beware! \n\nI don't know why it's such a fantastic sammy, but trust, it is!  I think it's just the combination of delicious (and fatty) ingredients that does the job.  It's just one more food experience that makes Pittsburgh's dining unique. \n\nIf you're visiting Pittsburgh, go here?  If you're new to Pittsburgh, go here! If you just need your fill of a sandwich with more sides on it than you usually order in a regular sitting, go here!"
-1,"This is one of the most over hyped restaurant that I have ever been to.  I know it's a Pittsburgh legend. I have been there several times and every time say to myself, I won't be going back.  I only go there when dragged by coworkers.  \n\nThe restaurant is always packed, service is slow and you have to get up to get a drink refill from the cashier.  Yes it's unique having fries and cole slaw on your sandwiches, but the sandwiches are horrible.  Burnt Roast Beef or poor quality cheese steaks just don't cut it with me."
1,"This place was hard to find in the dark after a 5 day drive from Texas.\n\nFirst off, what's up with Pittsburgh and ginger ale?  I've never heard of any place serving ginger ale in a cup, bottle or can in Texas, but here it seems to be everywhere!  Every place we stopped to eat and even a few bars recommended I try their ginger ale and it's really good!  So we all got that to drink.  \n\nTo start we tried the chili since it was posted on the wall as great chili.  A few friends told me \""don't get the chili, you're there for a sandwich.\""  They were right.  The chili wasn't good.  We don't put beans in chili here, and it should be thick, meaty, and able to eat through a spoon.  This stuff was weak, watery and full of beans and maybe some other vegetables.  Our chili would make people in Pittsburgh fall over dead.\n\nI got a double sweet and hot sausage sandwich, the wife had the Philly, and the kids had corned beef and a ham.  We had seen the hundreds of TV shows about this place and we were finally here to see if the mix of coleslaw, fries and meat was really as awesome as they say it is.   They were right.   The sandwiches didn't seem as big as they were on TV but they were freakin' awesome.  We all enjoyed these sandwiches more than any sandwich we had ever had before.   We had just had a long day of eating tons of bacon and bacon booze, so I didn't think any of us would be able to finish a big sandwich.  WE DID.  It was soooo good.  \n\nThe only bad part about coming to Pittsburgh and visiting Primanti Bros is that we had to go back home the next day!"
-1,"Always love Primanti's and I was Central Pittsburgh area, so I went for lunch. It was after the rush and wasn't too busy but the waitresses acted like it was. I was told to sit myself, which is cool since I wanted to sit outside. But then two waitresses kept coming and going without even looking at me. Finally a third came and took my order. I got my usual.... pastrami, extra cheese, no tomato, add egg. When did she miss the \""no tomato\""? I got my sammich (eventually) and there was the tomato. I immediately wanted to send it back but the waitress was gone again MIA. She just disappeared again. I waited as long as I could but she never came back. I finally carried the sloppy tomato seed-covered bread back into the restaurant myself and told the cook I needed a new piece of bread. He gave it to me with a funny look, then I ate my sammich, and then five minutes later the waitress finally showed up. Until then she was just missing. I was so annoyed, but when she came back it was just to refill my drink. A few minutes later I needed my bill, but guess what, she was gone again! I had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it. I was really annoyed. Love me some Primantis but the Market Square one has terrible service."
-1,"Previous reviews have said it well: Lackluster, tasteless food.\n\nAte at Primanti Bros with a group of friends while in Pittsburgh; we heard about it from 'Man vs. Food' and were assured that it is a Pittsburgh institution. The sandwiches are large and the pricing is fine ($6-$9), but what you get is a sloppy sandwich with food service-grade meat topped with lukewarm fries. Good in theory, bland in execution; it's a lot of calories without the accompanying flavor.\n\nWe also had terrible service at the Market Square location; I'll chalk this up to a fluke. The patio seating at the Market Square location is wonderful on a sunny day, but it started to rain and they actually retracted the awning, explaining that it wasn't designed to get wet --but apparently their customers are.\n\nThe legacy and infamy might tempt you to eat here, but take your money elsewhere and buy good-tasting food instead of kitsch."
-1,"There was basically no cheese on my \""cheese combo sandwich\"", the fries were gross, and the waitress was nasty to us."
1,"People knock on this place - but I always find myself defending it. \n\nWhile it may be overrated for being featured on the food network, it is a pretty good sandwich place (no not just because the portions...while they are generous) \n\nThe fries are a bit bland but I'm a huge fan of the cole slaw they have there - while it may not be anything \""special\"" it's a classic (not creamy cole slaw mind you). The colossal fish sandwich is pretty good. The cheese steak is not a cheese steak! But that's because I'm from Philadelphia and any cheese steak that isn't made and prepared there is not a cheese steak to me. \n\nThe only thing is the sanitation there is...questionable.  Just don't think about the sticky surfaces and slimy-ish floors. \n\nFor a cheap, giant sandwich I'd take the germs any day."
0,"Had to visit the \""Famous\"" Primanti Brother's Bar and Grill during my first visit to Pittsburgh, but most likely will only go back if my friends/family really  want to eat there.\n\nFood:  The portions are huge, not very greasy, served nice and hot but over all very bland.  I got the Colossal Fish and Cheese sandwich.  The beer batter fish was a very large piece and by itself was not bad tasting at all (just a little under seasoned.)  The fries were limp and had no seasoning what so ever. The fries were the worse part of the sandwich.  The coleslaw was  very mild, sweet and vinegar base, and by itself it was ok, but put everything together between two slices of white bread and it made for a bland pile of flavorless starch.  The bread was also too soft and did not hold up well at all, and the cheese was nonexistent.  I ended up having to add a ton of salt, pepper and malt vinegar to my sandwich, picked it apart and ate the pieces with my fingers.\n\nPrice:  For the size of the portions you get, the price is great!  I got two sandwiches and a soda for about $16.  Their sandwiches range from around $6 - $8 each, and are a good value since you will definitely leave full (I took home left overs.)\n\nAtmosphere:  After reading a few reviews about the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this place was not packed with tourist.  For being such a small dinner, the place was fairly empty so I was able to sit anywhere I liked (being a solo traveler, restaurants often try to stick me at the bar but I prefer to sit at a table.)  The tables were clean and organized well, and each table had a stack of paper menus to look at.  It felt like a comfy, good ol' local dinner where you can casually relax and eat.\n\nStaff:  During my visit, the staff was great!  There was only one waitress and one cook, but both were pleasant and greeted me as soon as I walked in.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.  The cook also thanked me for patronizing there while I was leaving.\n\nOver all, I basically came here just to say that I visited a famous Pittsburgh restaurant, but I most likely will not go there again.  If I was with friends or family who wanted to go to Primanti's I would go along, but I wouldn't go solo.  The blandness of the food is what kills it for me.  I would rather get a sandwich that is half the size with more flavor, then a huge pile of bland food."
0,"This is a neither a yay or nay place for me.  Understanding the underlying concept of the sandwiches from way back when, can make a person appreciate Primanti's for what they are.\n\nI ordered the pastrami served on two thick slices of bread, layered with french fries and cole slaw.  Granted, I like my carbs, but this was overload for me.  I wasn't particularly fond of the cole slaw either.  \n\nI think this is more of an acquired taste kind of place.  Not that I wouldn't go back, it's okay for an occasional visit.  There are other sandwiches to try.  But if you're used to the true pastrami with Swiss on rye, I wouldn't recommend the sandwich here.\n\nThe place itself is small and good for a group of four.  Eight if you don't mind sitting at two separate tables that are relatively close to each other."
0,"I wanted Pittsburgh food, and the internets sent me here.  Do not be intimidated to walk in this dump.  I went to the take out line and ordered a spicy sandwich something or another.  The bartenders are either overworked or just don't give a shit cause I waited for a while before ordering.  But stay strong, and look them down until they take your order. PS make sure you get sauce in those little packets.  Sammich is at best 6/10 but is comes with fries on the sandwich, fries!! Isn't that crazy everyone, fries on a sandwich!"
-1,"I just moved here back in September and one of the first places i was told to go for great food was Primanti Bros. The food was great as I was told from several people from the area and back home.\n\nWhat I was not happy with was the setting policy and service. Just to get a seat here I had to wait standing up watching people eat like a creepy stalker just to see who would get up first and finally when I got a seat no one cleaned our table for a while or even took our order cause no one even knew we had been seated. If we were bad people we could have stolen the check from the last table as they had paid with cash. Once we got a servers attention and got the table cleared and our drinks and food ordered the server forgot our drinks and when we where finally able to flag her down our food came out not even 5 minutes later. In total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food. Don't even think about getting a refill I had to walk in and ask the bartender for refills for me and my family after being ignored several times. When we were done we wanted to leave but couldn't till we paid the bill and because we paid with credit card we had to wait for the server to return with our card. It took so long and with other people looking at us to get the hell up so they could sit we just walked in to retrieve the card at was just sitting on the back of the bar and had not yet been processed so I had to wait again.\n\nFood can only get you so far, so my suggestion is if you want a good Food and can wait an hour feel free and come here. If you don't have the time just go next door to the Subway."
1,"Primantis is the ideal Pittsburgh sandwich. Fries, coleslaw, provolone, whatever meat you'd like in between the famous mancinis bread. I love this location especially because of the hours. Living downtown it's hard to find places to eat late at night but the market Sqaure primantis is open till 12 o'clock 7 days a week. I've tried variations of the sandwich but my favorite so far is the pastrami. I went tonight and I'll be back again the near future."
-1,"Bread, slaw, tomato, fries, and a small piece of overcooked fish all piled together. Warm yiengling and mediocre service.   Aweful"
1,"This spot was the light of my life for about 3 solid weeks. From the first bite I could tell that parting ways with Pittsburgh would be heartbreaking. After driving out of pittsburgh and paying my friend for his leftover half a sandwich, I knew that id made a special connection. To that bacon egg and cheese waiting for me, I miss xou and cant wait to hold xou again."
0,"I would give it 3.5 stars. It was a solid sandwich for sure. I got the corned beef which was tasty the only thing I wish they added was some kind of sauce. I'm not sure if that comes on other sandwiches but it could have used some kind of mustard. The price is great too, four sandwiches , two orders of pickles, coleslaw, fries and beer for about 40 bucks. Can't complain about that! \n\nI would definitely"
0,"I found the sandwich I ate at Primanti Bros to be quite tasty!  As others have mentioned, the signature toppings of cole slaw (which I normally loathe, but, in this case, loved!), french fries and cheese accompany any of your \""meat\"" choices for a sandwich.  The menu is limited, and there are no frills or false pretenses here.  I would definitely eat here again!  I had the fish and cheese sandwich, and it was outstanding!  I can't give the place 5 stars, because it didn't completely wow me, and the others in my party were a little disappointed.  I think they may have just made bad choices for their \""meat\"" (kielbasa and the Pittsburgher), but I doubt I could get them to try it again.  But hey for only a little over $6 per sandwich, can one really complain?  Delicious!  I'll go back without 'em.  ;)  Not a lot of tables, and not even sure it's air conditioned, so don't bring your fancy clothes or your roaming toddler.  ;)"
1,"Today was the day we finally got to try this place!\n\nI was in the mood for a cheesesteak and the waitress suggested an angus sandwich.  While it was different from a cheesesteak that im used to, it was definitely delicious! However I would get the coleslaw on the side next time.  She suggested a Cajun chicken sandwich for my husband  (because he said he liked a little spice) he absolutely loved it! we washed it all down with a local IPA.\nAll in all great food, definitely worth the visit-- and great service! Our waitress happened to be from Harrisburg ( that's where we are from!) so we shared some really great conversation!!"
0,"This is a solid downtown lunch break spot. They run a special between like 11-2 where you can get 3 cuts buffet style (with lots of different types) with a pop for 6 or 7 bucks. Perfect for those days when you oversleep and don't get a chance to pack a lunch. The pizza is nothing that you'd fall asleep dreaming of, but definitely hits the spot at 1PM on a workin' day."
1,"Being originally from Arizona, I know a good taco.  The taco stand outside of Reyna's is GOOD.   The carne asada meat was tender, though I usually prefer a little more char. A friend i was with got the beef tongue, a little too eccentric for my taste, but he loved it.  Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the tortilla.  I am usually tuned off by corn tortillas, but theirs are soft, not dry, and don't fall apart as the taco juices seep in. In other words exactly what you need for a good street taco.  The best part is the taco barrista squeezes fresh lime juice on top of the taco as a finishing touch. It really puts it over the top."
-1,"This has always been my 'go to' place to buy the most awesome, authentic flour tortillas.  I always  bought them fresh, still warm at times.  I have often served them at my  home and have sent many friends to shop there. Yesterday, I raved about how wonderful they were to a total stranger and we both bought 2 packages from 'the fridge up front'.  I was so so very disappointed and if the person I 'sold' them to reads YELP, I apologize. They were dry and stale.  Steaming them made them somewhat edible, but.....\nWhich leads to my next review....\nI was so excited when they opened their restaurant as they sell  such tasty tacos on the street.  I have been there 3 times.  First off, THE  BEST margarita!  Food ok but service......horrible!!  The most efficient wait staff appears to be a 10-12 year old boy who has made our guacamole and aims to please.  When we were there over the weekend, the waiter outside  could do nothing more than tell us how busy he was and how he had to take the steps with each order. He got our salsa order wrong so needless to say, we left. \nThis makes me sad to write this. Did they bite off more than  they can chew?"
-1,"I've lived in Pittsburgh for what feels like forever and in all of that time, I guess I've never been to the Strip District on a Monday. We didn't realize most of the restaurants are closed on Mondays. Tried Thin Man, closed. Luke Wholey's, closed. We read some less than appealing outdoor menus of a few spots and settled on Roland's Seafood Grill for lunch because they were open and had a sign out front raving about their signature warm Lobster Rolls for $14.99. Ok, we were game.\n\nWe've driven hours off the beaten path in Maine for amazing Lobster Rolls at Red's Eats, which sets the standard for what all lobster rolls should be. Massive amounts of fresh lobster piled on top of the bun and drawn butter to dip the excess mound of lobster in is a mouth watering delight! \n\nThat couldn't be farther from what you get served at Roland's. The bun was Mancini's, so good start. The lobster was an odd orange color that's not what fresh lobster looks like at all. Nothing was heaped over the bun at all, but honestly after tasting it that part was ok. Combination of a few fresher tasting pieces, some rubbery pieces, and some dry pieces that literally could have been any fish. I skipped the fries, which didn't look all that great on hubby's plate and there was the tiniest container of coleslaw ever as a side that was actually pretty good. Considering I skipped the fries, shouldn't the server have asked if I wanted extra coleslaw knowing it was going to be minuscule? \n\nThe upstairs patio was really nice overlooking Penn Ave. and I hear they have a decent happy hour with terrific specials on fresh oysters and beer at the bar. I may give this place another shot based on that but, never again on their lobster roll."
-1,"I use to love Rolands. However, the last few times we have been there it has been terrible.  While the food remains okay, the service leaves something to be desired.  Our waitress took longer than 15 minutes to come over and get our drink order; we had to get the hostess to find her.  She did not come back to the table for more than 20 minutes at a time.  The waitress was rude and less than helpful.  Our 1 drink and lunch took over two hours to complete.  Good thing they still have a good bloody mary."
-1,"WARNING ,,,,, this place is for SUCKERS ONLY ..... funky smelling ,worse tasting seafood ... overpriced ..... raunchy,un-clean restrooms .... only reason anyone goes here is because this is a ''tourist trap '' type neighborhood with some fun shopping spots nearby and this restaurant is positioned in the center of everything. As P.T. Barnum once said  '' There's a sucker born every minute '' ...... stay away ... any other restaurant will be better ."
-1,"Like a glutton for punishment, I hit up Roland's again last night while in town for business. I tired Kaya, but the wait was 30 + minutes.\n\nHere's the big clue I keep ignoring....the restaurant is EMPTY when everywhere else is crowded. Another issue is there's poor A/C in the dining room, which kind of sucks when it's 85 degrees and humid outside. \n\nI had a grilled vegetable sandwich and clam chowder. Same as before, it was just OK.  Service was better this time though. \n\nAll in all, I preferred my to go taco salad from doba the night before to this meal. \n\nSave your money and try somewhere else. \n\nPS. Beer selection is impressive if you want to drink beers from all around the world."
-1,"Ugh if I could give this place -10 stars I would. What a nightmare. To start, the first time I ate here, I almost swallowed a giant shard of plastic that was in my salad. Then to my horror, the bar tending goes \""whoops.\"" and tosses it on the floor!! \n\nFast forward a couple months, I decide to give this place a second chance. (I must have been delirious from hunger.)\nFirst off the bar tender was rude, slow as hell and terrible at making drinks. My friend and myself order our food and 20 min later out comes my friends food. After almost an hour of waiting, I still had NO pizza. When I asked the cranky pants bar tender in the NICEST possible way, where it was, he just shrugged and walked away. I asked to speak to a manager and was told he was \""busy.\"" Finally someone came to talk to me and after an hour and a half I got my shitty pizza. \nThank you to the kitchen manager for doing his job and coming to talk to the customer. But, to the bar tender working earlier New Year's Eve. You DO NOT DESERVE THIS JOB AND SHOULD BE FIRED."
1,"I have no complaints here.  European-style shop for gourmet coffee and tea.  You can buy fresh-brewed coffee or beans and loose leaf tea in bulk starting with a 1/4 pound and up.  Besides that, the shop is crammed with coffee and tea supplies, candies, and chocolates.  Good prices.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff.\n\nI usually buy coffee, but the last time I went in for green tea and wanted to try something new.  The man who waited on me didn't know a whole lot about tea, so he did something amazing:  he found someone else who did!\n\nTip: Go on Thursday afternoons when Market Square has their farmer's market and pick up some fresh produce and pierogies, too."
1,"I cannot count how many times I walked right past Nicholas Coffee Co, smelling the aroma of fresh roasted peanuts I love roasted peanuts, they're like my favorite food.  I remember the windows being very busy, and busy windows tend to scare me, like I cannot guess what's going on inside. After reading the Yelp reviews of Nicholas Coffee and co, and getting Downtown after 4:30pm I decided to go in.  \nI have fallen in love. This coffee shop had a frozen Chai on the menu, I am going on my lunch break tomorrow for that. The barista was smiling and seemed happy to be of service.\nOn this visit I played it safe and got a iced latte with vanilla flavoring, omg it was so delicious. Refreshing sweet and energizing.  I cannot wait until my next visit to this coffee shop, it was really a treat. \n\nOne entire wall was lined with tea!!! There were roasted nuts of all kinds, honey and huge variety of coffees. Shame on me for not giving this place a change earlier, now it's time to play catch up :)"
1,"So Many coffees to choose from, so little time. Really awesome coffee shoppe, which happens to be the oldest in the city and the most delicious smelling! They staff here is super friendly and enthusiastic about the precious beans. Its quaint and charming with a old rustic touch. Prices are reasonable and what you'd expect. Definitely a good place to stop if your around market square"
1,I love this place. I eat here anytime I go downtown for anything. Always get the Gyro with extra meat and sauce. So amazing. YUM!
0,"Not the best ever, but pretty decent stuff.  A slice for $2.50 in downtown? I'll be back."
-1,"This is the first time in a long while (10 yrs?) and now I remember why. The food is fair at best for the main meal. The salad is good but small. The hummus is a little bland. The best parts were the \""homemade\"" wine, both white and red, kinda like adult kool-aid  and the Jackie O cake was great. My issue was the price, $59. for dinner for 2. For this price, I would have expected more.I can't believe the 4 and 5 star reviews that I have read on this site. It's hard to believe that this place rates so many opposing reviews. I will never go back here again."
-1,"So our intentions were to eat at the Indian place across the street however a lady ran across the street and started rattling off the menu as we were walking. At first I liked her moxy, but soon realized that if this is how they need to bring in customers we may be in trouble. Another mistake was sitting outside when they are trying to bring people in. Our dinner conversation was constantly interrupted by the servers yelling across the street and on the side walk at potential customers. \n\nNow on to the food:\n\nI ordered the chicken kabob. Very bland and it actually tasted baked not grilled. I didn't finish it.  The rice was good and the side veggies weren't bad. The spinach pie was ok. \n\nThey will ask \""would you like hummus to snack on before your meal\"". This is not free or included. I figured this so I wasn't caught off guard. Some people I could see will be surprised at the end when they get the bill. \n\nMy wife got the lamb kabob. Bland again and very chewy. It didn't taste fresh, almost frozen at one point and microwaved. The cheese pie was pretty bad.\n\nHummus was ok. \n\n2 stars for the food\n3 stars for service\n1 star for the experience with yelling and fishing for customers. Seems like they may be in trouble financially and could be cutting corners to stay afloat. \n\nI will not go again. Alihan's next door is amazing, I recommend them over Christo's every day."
-1,"I had spaghetti warehouse delivered to my apt and I ordered spaghetti and meatballs while my boyfriend ordered chicken Parmesan. First off, we both asked for Caesar salads (which we paid extra for) and we didn't even get them. Besides that, the sauce was less than mediocre - a glorified ketchup with noodles. The chicken was dry and we couldn't eat half of the meals. Overall, very poor experience with spaghetti warehouse. You're better off getting fast food noodles from noodles and company. Seriously disappointed especially since it is called the SPAGHETTI warehouse. Very hard to mess up spaghetti."
-1,"No, nope, uh uh, no way, please don't call this an Italian restaurant. Overcooked, mushy noodles, watery tomato gravy, and meatballs that are too garlicky and over spiced. Can't give this place anything lower than 1 star. Seriously, Olive Garden is a joke and I rate it higher than this place. \n\nAgain, my advice to any Italian food lover, find a good neighborhood, family owned restaurant and support a family and not a conglomerate."
-1,"Ewww, the food here is terrible.  Nothing I had tasted good.  It tasted like it had been sitting under the food warmers for hours.  The service is luke warm at best.  Just skip it.  There's so many other places out there for good italian food."
1,"Visited Morton's last night for dinner before the show. After we were seated, our waiter greeted us shortly after with the menus. The menu has a perfect amount of options. Not too many and still enough to have a complete variety. Chicken, chops, seafood, and most important, STEAK! For a salad, we started off with the chopped spinach salad. It was perfect, as I am very particular with how my salads are dressed. The dressing wasn't dripping off, it was evenly and perfectly coated. I chose the 6 oz filet mignon, with 2 bacon wrapped scallops and 3 grilled shrimp for my dinner. It was more than enough. The steak was so tender and juicy! I would definitely go back to Morton's again and again for a wonderful meal!"
-1,"After an unpleasant experience at Lotus Grocery on 17 February 2014, I want to caution customers to be careful when paying with cash at the store.  \n\nMy order was $3.08.  I gave the glum and cold middle aged female cashier $10.10.  She put the $10 bill in the till and gave me $2.02 change, which would have been correct had I given her a $5 bill.  I told her that I gave her a ten dollar bill, and she repeatedly insisted that I did not.\n\nI went to the mean middle aged man who appears to be manager or owner and told him of the problem.  He was not interested in hearing it and it eventually fell into the lap of a short, middle aged woman who also appears to be manager, and is one of the nicer people on the staff.\n\nI got nowhere until I asked that a count of the register receipts.  The woman who  appears to be in management suggested that I leave my phone number and that I would be called after the store closes and a count is completed. That was not acceptable to me. I asked that a count be conducted while I waited and she agreed.  As she counted and recounted, I waited patiently.  She ultimately concluded that I was right and gave me my $5.00.  She apologized multiple times; the clerk who would have cheated me out of $5 did not.\n\nI will be careful when shopping at this store.  I will try to pay with one dollar bills in the future and will announce how much money I am handing to the cashier. There is a bitter taste in my mouth about Lotus Grocery.  Of all places for this to happen, it would have to be one where there is a language barrier and where most of the employees are dismissive of the customer.  This is not Giant Eagle!"
-1,"I was walking back and forth through downtown over a series of days and saw Madonna's. I made it a point to tell myself that I should stop in and get myself something to eat. I love Tex-Mex food and am always looking for new places to patronize. \n\nI stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go. When I received my order I immediately opened it to take a bite. I was immediately underwhelmed. I saw that they had some Tapatio and added it to the full course of my burrito and took my leave of the little corner store.\n\nThe best part of the burrito was the Tapatio that I added after the fact. The issues with it were myriad. My biggest issue was the utter lack of any taste. That's right, my burrito had no flavor. How do you make a steak burrito with guacamole and pinto beans without any flavor what-so-ever in any of the components? Not far behind that question was the fact that my steak burrito had almost no steak. It was all beans and guacamole. Don't get me wrong, I like beans and guacamole when they are properly made, but I ordered a STEAK burrito and not a bean burrito seasoned with a few pieces of meat.\n\nI might try this place again to give it another chance, but I would stay away from the steak burrito and would most likely eat vegan that day just to see if the lack of flavor was situational."
-1,"Well, it's food!! That's about all I can say for The Smithfield Cafe.  \nI had the \""daily special\"" which is pretty much the universal way of condensing \""two eggs, bacon or sausage, and toast\"" into two words. Sausage was room temperature, eggs were decent, and the greasy home fries contained the flavor of the dozen meals that were cooked before mine this morning (not i'n a good way). Coffee was plentiful, but not flavorful. \nThe waitresses were grizzled and archetypal for their profession.  \nTo surmise; meh..."
0,"I remember back circa 1991 when I was a freshman in high school, everybody read IN PITTSBURGH.  It was THE free weekly newspaper and it had the concerts, comic strips, and news features that the Post Gazette and the Tribune Review would not touch.  Somewhere along the line, probably when I was a junior or so, the new kid PITTSBURGH CITY PAPER came along.  I didn't think it would survive.  After all, Pittsburgh didn't need TWO of the same thing.\n\nWell, I was wrong.  IN PITTSBURGH is no more and the PITTSBURGH CITY PAPER is the source for alternative news and such that IN PITTSBURGH used to provide.  I was never one for the news that these types of papers provide.  I like to read CITY PAPER'S take on things.  But these papers are best for concert reviews, happenings around town, and movie reviews."
1,Wonderful experience!
-1,"average at best. Best view of the city by far though. Go in summer or no point in going. \n\nThe beer battered fish is good, yet there's much better in the city. It's nice and crispy, served on a fresh roll, tartar, lettuce, all that jazz. However again it's not worth venturing over for unless weather is perfect for an evening outside. \n\nChicken quesidilla, same thing. Average. \n\nI've went for 6 years now waiting for it to become something good. It's not going to happen. But I'll keep trying hoping."
-1,"Rotten food and over charging customer.\n\nI was expecting at least a reasonable dinning experience at a reputed restaurant, but was greatly disappointed. The restaurant charged me 20% premium over prices on online menu (I ordered takeout), denied there are prices online. The maitre D was reluctant to show the printed menu, which is 10% more expensive than online, led me to think the over charge was deliberate. \nThe crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from ROTTEN crab. Since I didn't have time to walk 10min one way to return the food, it had to be thrown away.   A lunch over charged and wasted."
-1,They must get patrons here in because of the could reviews from the other Tambellini restaurant or from being close to the theater district.  The food is pretty bad for an Italian restaurant.  The Chicken Parmigiana was very bready and I question if it was homemade.  I ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce.  The homemade bread was very sorry.....  Not worth the price.  The decor is very plain.  Service was fine.
-1,"It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for \""we read on Yelp this place sucks, but we wanted to give it a try\"" to which she replied they don't alow that but I will let it slide. The food could have come from a buffet and been better. I hate to be super negative, but in this case I am just being real."
-1,"The only good thing about this eatery is its proximity to the Benedum. The three of us were seated at a table that was jammed in between two other tables, next to the kitchen - even though the place was half empty. I could hear the conversation at the next door table better than that of people sitting opposite me. The food was a sorry, sloppy, soggy mess that would have had Chef Ramsey throw up. The service was slow, inattentive, and made you feel vaguely unwelcome. Ridiculously overpriced. For  better value, a nicer atmosphere, and quality food, I strongly recommend a couple of places nearby that beat Tambellini's hands down - McDonalds or SubWay."
1,"I went here on the day of a wedding (I'm from out of town) for a last minute pedicure. I didn't really know where else to go, so I just stopped here on a whim (it was raining and this was the closest place that seemed to do nails). \n\nThe Salon Nuvo nail person is FANTASTIC (and wonderful to chat with). It's two full weeks later and it looks like my pedicure is brand new (and before you ask, I actually used the exact same brand/color nail polish as my prior crap pedicure). They don't have the cool massage chairs and they put you in a weird little intimate back room, HOWEVER I would totally give that up for a beautiful pedicure that lasts this long.  \n\nThought it was worth a review."
